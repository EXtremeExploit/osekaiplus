# osekaiplus
* An userscript designed to improve user experience on https://osekai.net.

## Cool, what does it do?
* **Fix recently viewed panel when user has no userdata**
* **Add medal counts to rarity rankings**
* **Add more info to unachieved medals sections**
* **Add colors to users in rankings**
* Make user progresion dialogs simpler
* Simplify rescriction banner into a single text, bringing back the screen space

## Thats very cool. How do i get this?
* Install any userscript extension (Tampermonkey,Violentmonkey,Greasemonkey,etc)
* Click [here](./osekaiplus.user.js?raw=1) and a new tab will open asking you to install it
* enjoy ig

## I FOUND A BUG I WILL TELL OSEKAI STAFF
* No, please first check if the bug is still there after the userscript is turned off, don't annoy the staff just for a silly bug they don't even have anything to do, if the bug is only present when the script is on, [open a new issue](https://github.com/EXtremeExploit/osekaiplus/issues/new)
